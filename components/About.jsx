    <p>Thanks for stopping by! The goal of this project was to visually present general information on the human anatomy.
      This project was built from the ground up over the course of a few days and although this project is still a work in progress, 
      the tech stack that was used so far includes React, Next, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.
      I hope you were able to learn something new during your visit!</p>
